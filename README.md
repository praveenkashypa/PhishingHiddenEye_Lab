# PhishingHiddenEye_Lab
# Overview
This project documents my hands-on practical lab using HiddenEye, a powerful phishing simulation framework. The objective of this lab was to understand how phishing attacks are created, deployed, and executed from an attacker’s perspective—specifically for educational and defensive cybersecurity learning. The project demonstrates how phishing pages are generated, how victims’ interaction is logged, and how captured credentials or metadata are displayed to the attacker’s terminal.

# Disclaimer
This project is strictly for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes. All activities were performed in a controlled lab environment. Never use phishing tools for illegal or unethical activity.

# Objectives
Learn how phishing attacks work technically. Understand how phishing pages are cloned and hosted. Analyse victim interaction logs and captured data. Strengthen defensive awareness for SOC/Blue team roles. Build a practical understanding of social engineering attack vectors.
